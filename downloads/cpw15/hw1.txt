Wireless (Wi-Fi) networking speeds, the technology behind broadcast streams, and wireless security have greatly improved user connectivity, which in turn has increased the use of multi-purpose devices such as smartphones and tablets in corporate and SOHO networks. The freedom of Wi-Fi has become the infrastructure of choice and essentially relegated wired networks more to moving mass data traffic and less user traffic. Although it will not eliminate the wired infrastructure, because Wi-Fi access points need to connect to a wired device using the Ethernet standard, Wi-Fi allows greater expandability and access for IT departments in both corporate and SOHO environments.

At the time when Wi-Fi became viable for implementation, the wired standard available in most corporate and SOHO networks operated at 100 Mbps. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standards Committee creates and maintains media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for implementing WLAN computer communication. The IEEE 802.11 standard is overarching guidance that has been provided for the large number of wireless standards. The IEEE Wi-Fi standard is 802.11 with a small letter designation referring to the next revision (e.g., 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ad, etc.). Each standard (like 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11n) is differentiated by the frequency range or frequency band that it utilizes.

The 802.11 standard was initially ratified in 1997 and devices compliant with the 802.11a and 802.11b revisions became commercially available soon after in 2000. Despite higher throughput, 802.11a devices were not as readily adopted as 802.11b devices. At the time Wi-Fi became viable to deploy 802.11b at a maximum throughput of 11 Mbps, wired networks were at a minimum of 100 Mbps in most corporate and SOHO environments. The slower throughput kept users more reliant on traditional desktop machines and less likely to use their new wireless-capable laptops wirelessly. Once 802.11g was sufficiently saturated in the market, the disparity between its 54 Mbps speed and the 100 Mbps speed of wired networks became less noticeable and consumers became more interested in being wireless. The industry continued to push for ways to design higher throughput devices and incorporate the hardware into mobile devices such as cell phones, tablets, and lighter-weight laptops.

Wireless LANs use two primary frequency bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The 2.4 GHz range actually encompasses 2.4 to 2.5 GHz frequencies, while the 5 GHz range is 5.75 GHz to 5.875 GHz. Each frequency band has specific channels (or small portions of frequency) at which the devices operate to avoid overlapping with other wireless LAN devices. For 2.4 GHz frequency bands, it is important to choose channels 1, 6, and 11 to avoid overlapping frequencies. This is because overlapping can cause interference in your networks and cause data transmission and receiving issues for the devices.
