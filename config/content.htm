<h4>SSH 網路連線加密機制</h4>
<p>SSH 指 Secure SHell, 是一種網路連線加密機制, 當我們在 Mac OS 或 Linux 操作系統中的 Terminal 或 XTerm 時, 可以利用 ssh 帳號@遠端主機 ip 或符號名稱, 就可以輸入認證密碼, 登入到遠端主機.</p>
<p>一般針對公開的 Github 倉儲, 任何人都可以直接透過 https 協定 clone 倉儲, 無需認證, 但是倉儲協同者若要從近端將改版資料送到 Github, 就必須通過認證, 假如採 https 協定, 則倉儲協同者在推送改版資料時, 必須提供帳號與密碼.</p>
<p>除了 https 協定, Github 也接受倉儲的協同者以 SSH 連線的方式, git clone private 倉儲, 或以 SSH 連線的方式將近端改版資料推送到遠端倉儲.</p>
<p>SSH 的連線加密機制依賴 private key 與 public key 之間的配對, 當使用者建立 SSH key pair 時, private key 必須保護在近端, 而 public key 則必須送到進行認證的遠端伺服器中.</p>
<h4>建立 OpenSSH key pair</h4>
<p>Github 伺服器所支援的 SSH 為 OpenSSH 檔案格式的協定, 因此使用者要送到 Github 伺服器上的 OpenSSH 格式 public key, 可以透過 portablegit 中的 sh.exe 進入 SHell, 然後利用以下指令建立採 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">rsa</a> 加密演算法的 key pair:</p>
<pre class="brush:js;auto-links:false;toolbar:false" contenteditable="false">ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "使用者學號"</pre>
<p>在 -C 後的使用者學號字串, 會直接附加在 OpenSSH public key 檔案的最後端, 讓使用者得以辨識 public key 的對應使用者, 而所建立的 OpenSSH private key 則可以透過 puttygen 轉換為 putty 特有檔案格式.</p>
<h4>Putty 作為 SSH 連線客戶端工具</h4>
<p>Putty 套件可用於 Windows 與 Linux 操作系統, 可以讓使用者以 SSH 加密機制遠端登入到其他伺服器主機, 由於電腦輔助設計室電腦的第三磁區上課時會轉為純 IPv6 協定上網, 當使用者要將近端改版資料推送到遠端時, 由於 Github 至今仍只支援 IPv4 網路協定, 因此無論是以 https 或 ssh 方式連線, 都必須透過能同時支援 IPv4 與 IPv6 的代理主機.</p>
<p>以 https 協定對 Github 連線的代理主機設定位於 home/.gitconfig, 而在 Windows 10 操作系統中採 SSH 對 Github 連線, 就必須將代理主機與 private key 的設定, 透過 Putty 完成.</p>
<h4>以 SSH 協定與 Github 連線</h4>
<p>1. 建立一對 OpenSSH key pair, private key 保留在近端, 將 public key 登記在 Github 所屬帳號設定中.</p>
<p>2. 近端可攜系統啟動時, 必須確認已經設定</p>
<pre class="brush:js;auto-links:false;toolbar:false" contenteditable="false">set GIT_SSH=%Disk%:\putty\plink.exe</pre>
<p>表示 git 將透過 putty 工具以 ssh 加密協定對 Github 連線</p>
<p>3. 在 Putty 中設定對 github.com ssh 時必須提供的 Proxy 代理主機設定與 Auth 認證所需的近端 private key, 而且必須利用 puttygen 將 OpenSSH 格式轉為 putty 檔案格式</p>
<p>4. 無論在 git clone 或 git push (URL 位於倉儲 .git/config 中), URL 必須使用 <a href="mailto:git@github.com:帳號/倉儲名稱.git">git@github.com:帳號/倉儲名稱.git</a> 連線</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Digitization is the transformation from analog to digital or digital<br/>representation of a physical item with the goal to digitize and<br/>automate processes or workflows.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Digital Business is the creation of new business designs by blurring<br/>the digital and physical worlds. It promises to usher in an<br/>unprecedented convergence of people, business and things that<br/>disrupts existing business models - even those born of the Internet<br/>and e-business eras.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Digital Transformation is the novel use of digital technology to solve<br/>traditional problems. These digital solutions enable - other than<br/>efficiency via automation - new types of innovation and creativity,<br/>rather than simply enhance and support traditional methods.<br/>Success is anchored in both digital business and digitization.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Interoperability: The ability of machines, devices, sensors, and<br/>people to connect and communicate with each other via the<br/>Internet of Things (IoT) or the Internet of People (IoP).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Information transparency: The ability of information systems to<br/>create a virtual copy of the physical world by enriching digital<br/>plant models with sensor data. This requires the aggregation of<br/>raw sensor data to higher-value context information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Technical assistance: First, the ability of assistance systems to<br/>support humans by aggregating and visualizing information<br/>comprehensibly for making informed decisions and solving urgent<br/>problems on short notice. Second, the ability of cyber physical<br/>systems to physically support humans by conducting a range of<br/>tasks that are unpleasant, too exhausting, or unsafe for their<br/>human co-workers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Decentralized decisions: The ability of cyber physical systems to<br/>make decisions on their own and to perform their tasks as<br/>autonomously as possible. Only in the case of exceptions,<br/>interferences, or conflicting goals, are tasks delegated to a higher<br/>level.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In addition to being able to adapt to advances in technology, the<br/>person needs to be able to communicate and relate to people (from<br/>different disciplines, cultures, values) who may not be co-located.<br/>Talent in a digitally transforming enterprise ($Talent_{dt}$) can loosely be<br/>expressed as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">$Talent_{dt} = Talent + Generative Learning$</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Generative learning is learning that enhances our capacity to innovate<br/>and create. Foundational to it is the active integration of new ideas<br/>with the learner’s existing schemata.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We cannot teach people how to learn what is needed, unlearn what is<br/>no longer relevant and re-learn that which is still needed.<br/>We can provide an opportunity for people to learn by reflecting on<br/>doing (Experiential Learning).</p>

<p>2016</p>
<p>By 2020, the workplace will look very different from the one we see today. Companies will function in a vastly more <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">digitized environment</span>, but 30 percent of them will fail because there aren't enough workers with the skills to drive the <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">digital transformation</span> that companies need.</p>
<p>Analysts are forecasting a global shortage of 38 million to 40 million college-educated workers, a gap that will affect advanced nations as well as emerging countries. And the length of tenure in a job is shortening as well. The average time a worker spends in one job has declined from five to seven years to only two to three years, widening the gap between supply and demand. This session will explore the critical changes that must be made to give workers the skills required in the workforce of tomorrow.</p>

<p>2017</p>
<p>In the eyes of top executives, their job is to imagine the future and work towards making that imagined future a reality. Many of the largest companies in the world are intent on embracing change and building pathways that lead to a robust workforce, innovation and job creation. Corporate leaders must pursue and encourage growth while also promoting values that reach beyond the bottom line.</p>
<p>How do business leaders build and drive the workforce of the future? <br/>Change can be an amorphous concept; how should corporations define and pursue it? <br/>What are the most effective ways for CEOs and other top executives to combine growth and purpose to reflect workforce and corporate values and culture?</p>

<h4>for 重複迴圈的應用</h4>
<p>接下來要在頁面中插入 11 張圖, 希望寬度為 600 且 img 屬性加入 add_border.</p>
<p>第一張圖以手動方式插入後, 手動進入 html 編輯, 加入 class="add_border" 屬性後, 取得插入圖檔的 html 如下:</p>
<pre class="brush:html;auto-links:false;toolbar:false" contenteditable="false">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/1_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
<p>隨後的 10 張圖希望利用 Python 迴圈產生後再從 html 編輯插入.</p>
<p><img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/1_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"/></p>
<p><img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/2_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"/></p>
<p><img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/3_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"/></p>
<p><img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/4_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"/></p>
<p><img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/5_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"/></p>
<p><img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/6_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"/></p>
<p><img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/7_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"/></p>
<p><img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/8_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"/></p>
<p><img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/9_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"/></p>
<p><img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/10_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"/></p>
<p><img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/11_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"/></p>
<p>上述利用迴圈插入具有規律的字串程式碼為:</p>
<pre class="brush:py;auto-links:false;toolbar:false" contenteditable="false">'''
參考用的 html 字串為
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/1_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
'''
firstSegment = '''&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="add_border" height="342" src="/images/'''

secondSegment = '''_cp_git_and_cmsimde.png" width="600"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'''

for i in range(2, 12):
    print(firstSegment + str(i) + secondSegment)</pre>
<p>其於 SciTE 編輯器執行畫面:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="add_border" height="398" src="/images/cp_w2_python_for_loop_application1.png" width="600"/></p>
<p>請問, 當成功以 <a>https://localhost:9443</a> 對 CMSiMDE 動態網站連線時出現以下畫面, 代表甚麼意思?</p>
<p><img alt="" class="add_border" height="297" src="/images/https_9443_panic.png" width="600"/></p>
<p>當我們成功完成 CMSiMDE 動態網站內容, 且利用  generate_pages 按鈕轉為靜態網站資料後, 要利用 git 指令新增提交退送時, 碰到以下問題:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="add_border" height="354" src="/images/cp_git_config_user_email_name.png" width="600"/></p>
<p>接著配合畫面中的提示, 利用 git config 指令操作結束後, 接著嘗試以 git push 將改版資料推送到遠端, 結果又出現下列畫面:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="add_border" height="354" src="/images/cp_push_rejected_need_git_pull.png" width="600"/></p>
<p>根據提示, 以 git pull 拉下遠端與近端的差異資料後, 又出現下列畫面, 因為提示中拉下的資料與 Leo Editor 有關, 因此在命令列視窗中輸入 leo, 試著開啟 Leo Editor, 結果出現的小視窗無論如何操作都會落入重複迴圈, 於是在 y:\home\.leo 目錄中, 以 SciTE 編輯器建立一個 .leoID.txt 檔案, 內容為任何字串, 然後以 stop.bat 關閉可攜系統之後, 再以 start.bat 開啟系統, 終於能夠開啟 Leo Editor, 並利用 git push 將近端資料成功送到 github.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="add_border" height="423" src="/images/cp_doing_git_pull.png" width="600"/></p>
<ol>
<li>請問, git config --global 指令執行成功後, 這些設定會存在哪裡?</li>
<li>另外假如我們不是使用可攜程式套件而是使用電腦輔助設計室中電腦所安裝的 Python 以及 git, 但是卻想在其他用戶所存放的 git config identity 中, 提交屬於自己帳號下的 comment, 該如何操作?</li>
<li>上述的流程設定, 必須每一次推送時都輸入 github 所登錄的帳號與密碼, 假如在協同者面前輸入帳號密碼時, 其他人都一直盯著我的鍵盤看, 該如何是好?</li>
<li>上述在 git push 之前需要 git pull 的原因是甚麼?</li>
<li>上述 Leo Editor 啟動時, 為何會進入重複迴圈?</li>
<li>CMSiMDE 是用甚麼程式語言建立的?</li>
<li>CMSiMDE 為什麼有動態網站與靜態網站的設計?</li>
<li>假如每一班都配給一台 Ubuntu 20.04 的伺服器, 可以配置與 Windows 10 相同的程式環境嗎? 假如我使用 MacBook 筆電也可以嗎?</li>

<p>建立 CP 2020 課程網頁</p>
<ol>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">以 mdecourse 帳號登入 github.com</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">建立 cp2020 空倉儲, 選擇由系統建立 README.md (延伸題目: 假如不新 README.md, 則又該如何操作?）</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">在近端啟動隨身程式系統 (或者自行在操作系統安裝所需套件)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">將遠端的 cp2020 倉儲 git clone 到近端 (延伸題目: git clone 是甚麼?)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">利用 git submodule add 導入 cmsimde 當作目錄</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">從近端 cmsimde 目錄中取出 up_dir 中的內容至 cp2020 倉儲根目錄</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">在近端可以進入 cmsimde 目錄, 以 python wsgi.py 啟動動態網頁 (延伸題目: 何謂動態網頁? 有何功能?)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">在近端編輯動態網頁內容後, 轉為靜態網頁 (如何轉?)</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">完成靜態網頁轉換之後, 利用近端 git 指令將新版本新增, 提交並推送到遠端</li>
</ol>
<p>在近端編寫第一個 Python 程式, 每修改一次都利用 git 進行提交, 修改並提交 4 次後, 可以在任何版本下回復到先前的任一版本內容.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">在近端使用電腦儲存檔案, 最理想的情況是要利用 git 或 Fossil SCM 等分散式版次管理套件, 將各版本的內容進行提交並註記改版緣由之後, 再從近端推送到遠端.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">使用分散式版次管理的目的</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">可以註記每次改版的提交者, 並能利用 git checkout 到先前的各版本</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">資料存一份在遠端, 避免因為近端電腦損毀而丟失資料.</p>

<h2>Heroku</h2>
<h4>Heroku 與計算機程式</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.heroku.com/">https://www.heroku.com/</a> 是提供雲端應用程式服務的網站, 在計算機程式課程中, 可以透過 Heroku 內建伺服 PHP 的功能, 將 CMSiMDE 系統的靜態網站送到 Heroku 進行伺服, 也可以設法利用 Heroku 執行 CMSiMDE 的動態網站, 只是根據 Heroku 系統的規定, 每 24 小時雲端主機重啟之後, 非以 Git 提交推送的資料將會被 reset.</p>
<p>因此在未設定 persistent 資料儲存方案的 Heroku 應用, 只適合配置用於直接查詢會轉介其他系統資料的網際 Python 應用.</p>
<h4>Heroku 應用</h4>
<p>以下將列出在計算機程式課程中的三種 Heroku 應用:</p>
<ol>
<li>將 CMSiMDE 的靜態網頁送到 Heroku 伺服</li>
<li>利用 Heroku 配置 Webster 與 Wordnet 字典查詢服務 (透過 SQLite 資料庫)</li>
<li>利用 Heroku 上的 Flask 網際 ajax 程式, 從學校教務伺服器中取出課程相關資料</li>
</ol>

<h4>MCAD</h4>
<h4>雲端電腦輔助機械設計工具的比較</h4>
<p><a href="https://total3dprinting.org/onshape-vs-fusion-360/">https://total3dprinting.org/onshape-vs-fusion-360/</a> 是電腦輔助設計實習與協同產品設計實習課程中的議題之一, 比較 onshape 與 fusion 360 的功能與特性.</p>
<h4>利用 Python 建立雲端程式工具</h4>
<p>結合 Brython, Javascript Gist 與近端程式系統, 利用 Flask 為主體, 建立一個能夠部署在 Heroku 的 Python 網際程式編寫與執行系統.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">參考: <a href="http://mde.tw/lab/content/Python.html">http://mde.tw/lab/content/Python.html</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">原先的系統是直接將導引給 Brython 執行的 Python 程式, 直接寫在網頁中, 然後透過 Javascript 與 html 按鈕逐一帶出已經編寫存入網頁的程式, 然後修改執行.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">假如, 能夠使用 <a href="http://mde.tw/lab/content/Javascript.html">http://mde.tw/lab/content/Javascript.html</a> 與 <a href="http://mde.tw/lab/content/Dart.html">http://mde.tw/lab/content/Dart.html</a> 中的方法, 將 Python 程式存於 Gist 或 Github Pages 網站, 然後透過 ajax 的方式帶至網際瀏覽器中執行, 並能利用 Javascript 按鈕將在網頁編寫執行的 Python 程式存至近端, 放入特定倉儲中進行版次管理.</p>
<h4>網際 Markdown 網誌系統</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">利用 Flask 與 GMail oauth2 登入後, 使用者在瀏覽器中編輯 Markdown 格式之 Pelican 網誌文章, 存為唯一檔案名.md 後上傳至 GDrive 特定目錄, 可再透過 Google Blogger API 將 Markdown 轉為 html 後登錄至 Google Blogger.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">最終將 Flask 程式部署在 Heroku, 僅提供特定使用者利用 Gmail 帳號登入後編寫文章, 並分別對 Blogger 發表文章, 以及將 Markdown 文章上傳至 GDrive 備用.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">使用工具: Flask, Google GMail oauth2, GDrive API, Google Blogger API</p>
