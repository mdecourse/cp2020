It promises to usher in an unprecedented convergence of people, business and things that disrupts existing business models - even those born of the Internet and e-business eras. \n Digital Transformation is the novel use of digital technology to solve traditional problems. These digital solutions enable - other than efficiency via automation - new types of innovation and creativity, rather than simply enhance and support traditional methods. Success is anchored in both digital business and digitization. \n Interoperability: The ability of machines, devices, sensors, and people to connect and communicate with each other via the Internet of Things (IoT) or the Internet of People (IoP). \n Information transparency: The ability of information systems to create a virtual copy of the physical world by enriching digital plant models with sensor data. This requires the aggregation of raw sensor data to higher-value context information. \n Technical assistance: First, the ability of assistance systems to support humans by aggregating and visualizing information comprehensibly for making informed decisions and solving urgent problems on short notice. Second, the ability of cyber physical systems to physically support humans by conducting a range of tasks that are unpleasant, too exhausting, or unsafe for their human co-workers. \n Decentralized decisions: The ability of cyber physical systems to make decisions on their own and to perform their tasks as autonomously as possible. Only in the case of exceptions, interferences, or conflicting goals, are tasks delegated to a higher level. \n In addition to being able to adapt to advances in technology, the person needs to be able to communicate and relate to people (from different disciplines, cultures, values) who may not be co-located. Talent in a digitally transforming enterprise ($Talent_{dt}$) can loosely be expressed as follows: \n $Talent_{dt} = Talent + Generative Learning$ \n Generative learning is learning that enhances our capacity to innovate and create. Foundational to it is the active integration of new ideas with the learner’s existing schemata. \n We cannot teach people how to learn what is needed, unlearn what is no longer relevant and re-learn that which is still needed. We can provide an opportunity for people to learn by reflecting on doing (Experiential Learning). \n Machine Learning Applications for Furnamce Control and Process Optimization in Steelmaking.pdf \n 課程助教: \n 40723150 (lead), 40723110, 40723115, 40723138, 40723148 \n 40723145 (lead), 40723102, 40723103, 40723153, 40723245 \n 40723212 (lead), 40723216, 40723223, 40723246 \n 負責事項: \n 電腦輔助設計室電腦第三磁區系統維護 \n 每週四 19:00 - 21:00 在電腦輔助設計室為操作實習與助教協助回答問題時間 \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Topics.html'}, {'title': 'Video', 'text': "本課程所有學員都必須熟悉利用下列工具製作電腦操作過程錄影並協同進行線上直播與錄影: \n ShareX \n 課程進行中的所有操作細節都會利用  ShareX  進行錄影, 並將 mp4 影片檔案放入  cp2020 課程線上教學影片區 , 各學員可以直接利用電腦或手機觀看. \n Google Meet \n https://meet.google.com/ \xa0允許 @gm 用戶進行線上串流對談, 分享電腦操作畫面, 文字留言以及串流影音錄影等功能, 各分組學員必須熟悉如何操作並且在分組後每單數週, 利用  Google Meet  進行線上會議討論與錄影存證. \n Youtube  +\xa0 OBS \n OBS  支援多元的電腦影音來源組合功能, 配合  Youtube  的線上串流直播與錄影功能, 可以讓不參與會議者以文字留言板進行互動或在線上觀看直播.\xa0 各分組學員必須熟悉如何操作並且在分組後每雙數週, 利用  Youtube  +  OBS  進行線上會議討論與錄影存證. \n Wink \n Wink  是一套用來製作電腦操作流程說明用的工具, 之前 2.0 版本的輸出檔案為 Flash swf 檔案格式, 但因各瀏覽器將在  2020 年底停止支援 Flash 播放功能 , 因此目前作者正在測試能夠透過  FFMPEG  輸出 mp4 檔案的版本, 待其正式推出後將可用於課程教學中. \n 以下為參考用的線上影片: \n Deep Learning \n \n 2016 \n By 2020, the workplace will look very different from the one we see today. Companies will function in a vastly more  digitized environment , but 30 percent of them will fail because there aren't enough workers with the skills to drive the  digital transformation  that companies need. \n Analysts are forecasting a global shortage of 38 million to 40 million college-educated workers, a gap that will affect advanced nations as well as emerging countries. And the length of tenure in a job is shortening as well. The average time a worker spends in one job has declined from five to seven years to only two to three years, widening the gap between supply and demand. This session will explore the critical changes that must be made to give workers the skills required in the workforce of tomorrow. \n \n 2017 \n In the eyes of top executives, their job is to imagine the future and work towards making that imagined future a reality. Many of the largest companies in the world are intent on embracing change and building pathways that lead to a robust workforce, innovation and job creation. Corporate leaders must pursue and encourage growth while also promoting values that reach beyond the bottom line. \n How do business leaders build and drive the workforce of the future?  Change can be an amorphous concept; how should corporations define and pursue it?  What are the most effective ways for CEOs and other top executives to combine growth and purpose to reflect workforce and corporate values and culture? \n \n 2018 \n \n 2019 \n \n 2020 \n \n", 'tags': '', 'url': 'Video.html'}, {'title': 'W1Video', 'text': '1bw1cp_cadlab_networking.mp4 \n 說明綜一館八樓電腦輔助設計室上  KMOLab  課程時如何採 IPv6 設定 \n 為何要採用 IPv6 網路設定 \n 如何設定 IPv4 與 IPv6 雙支援的代理主機 \n 如何利用 ipconfig /all 查驗 Windows 10 網路設定結果 \n 2bw1cp_course_introduction.mp4 \n 計算機程式課程簡介 \n 課程評分流程簡介 \n 說明將使用  https://gitter.im/mdecourse/cp2020  收集並回答課程相關問題 \n 說明將使用\xa0 https://oli.cmu.edu/product-category/computer-science-programming-indep/ \xa0教材熟悉電腦硬體與軟體 \n 說明如何利用  ShareX  錄製電腦操作過程 \n 3aw1cp_sharex_github_introduction.mp4 \n Zoomit  工具介紹 \n 7zip  工具介紹 \n 說明如何利用\xa0 ShareX \xa0 錄製電腦操作過程 \n fall2020.7z  下載與使用 (第一版未安裝  CMSiMDE  所需模組) \n 介紹將在隨身系統,  Kaggle  與  colab  環境學習  Python \n 說明將使用\xa0 https://oli.cmu.edu/product-category/computer-science-programming-indep/ \xa0教材熟悉電腦硬體與軟體 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W1Video.html'}, {'title': 'W2Video', 'text': '4bw2cp_random_grouping.mp4 \n 利用線上程式進行亂數分組 \n 說明亂數分組程式牽涉教務處主機,  Heroku  雲端主機以及  Dart  轉 Javascript 等三個程式 \n 上課的資料將同步到  Github  與  Gitlab , 主要目的在建立資料保全的習慣 \n 亂數分組程式假設各組員能夠採用學號作為 Github 帳號 \n 說明針對規律型的超文件資料, 可以採用計算機重複迴圈建立所需的資料 \n 說明在系上可以從  http://a.kmol.info:88 \xa0主機下載所需的資料 \n 說明在 Windows 命令列指令的基本用法 \n 說明如何在近端啟動  CMSiMDE  動態網頁系統, 目的是進行網站內容的編輯 \n 5bw2cp_repo_cmsimde.mp4 \n 利用 50703199 帳號 demo  CMSiMDE  建立  Github Pages  網站的做法 \n Demo 如何對 Github 倉儲改名 \n 說明與可攜系統 start.bat 有關的 批次檔案指令 \n 說明 Windows 資料夾與隱藏檔案的檢視設定 \n 說明  git clone  以及  git submodule add  的用法, 目的在利用  CMSiMDE  建立個人網站 \n 說明  git config  用法 \n 6bw2cp_github_pages.mp4 \n 說明  Git 分支 用法, 並將個人 cp2020 倉儲的 master 設為 Github Pages 網頁的根目錄 \n 說明  Github Pages  網址與帳號之間的關聯 \n 說明近端  CMSiMDE  子模組新增後必須將  up_dir  資料複製到倉儲根目錄的用法 \n 說明如何在近端利用  CMSiMDE \xa0 動態網站管理網站內容 \n 說明如何將動態網頁轉成靜態網頁並 git add, git commit , git push 到遠端 Github 主機 \n 7aw2cp_kaggle_python.mp4 \n nslookup 用法說明 \n 說明如何在\xa0 Kaggle \xa0以及近端可攜程式環境, 利用 Python 編寫累加程式 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W2Video.html'}, {'title': 'W3Video', 'text': '8bw3cp_how_to_deal_with_vacant_repository.mp4 \n 說明如何處理  Github  空倉儲與近端倉儲間的資料連結設定 \n Windows path 命令與指令搜尋間的關係及用法 \n Windows 批次命令 echo 的用法 \n 說明  git init ,  git remote add , 以及  git push -u \xa0的用法 \n 說明 Windows 中如何修改將隱藏檔案與目錄檢視設定 \n 利用 Git 倉儲近端工作目錄與遠端倉儲之間同步進行資料保全 \n 說明對 Github 採 https 與 SSH 協定的語法差異 \n git push --set-upstream 的簡寫為 git push -u \n 9bw3cp_downlaod_v2_submodule_add_cmsimde.mp4 \n 說明如何在系上從  http://a.kmol.info:88 \xa0下載第二版的可攜程式環境 \n 再次提醒  git config  的用法, 包括 --global user.email, --global user.name 與 --global http.proxy \n 說明如何在近端利用執行  http-server.py  檢視  CMSiMDE  的靜態網頁 \n 說明當倉儲已經具有子模組則要從遠端 git clone 資料到近端, 必須使用 git clone --recurse-submodules URL.git 進行資料下載', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W3Video.html'}, {'title': 'W5Video', 'text': '10aw5_kaggle_variable_for_list_append.mp4 \n 說明可以利用命令列輸入 Python 進入互動模式逐步測試 Python 程式語法 \n 說明如何利用 print() 函式列印變數內容 \n 說明如何利用 typ() 列印物件的資料型別\xa0 \n 說明變數命名可以使用英文大小寫字母或底線開頭, 再加上其他數字, 大小寫英文字母或底線 \n 說明如何利用 " python read url file data" 搜尋網路上有關利用 Python 讀取網頁資料的用法 \n 說明 for 迴圈的基本用法 \n 說明 Python 程式利用四個空白鍵作為縮排的格式, 並且利用縮排來區隔執行範圍 \n 說明 NameError 與 SyntaxError 的發生情況 \n https://www.kaggle.com/mdecourse/w5cpa \xa0 \n https://www.kaggle.com/mdecourse/cp2020-hw2 \xa0 \n 11aw5_kaggle_list_for_to_anchor.mp4 \n 說明如何將網路上的資料讀進數列, 並且將每一列資料的最後符號刪除 \n 如何利用迴圈與字串組合產生所需要的 html 超文件資料 \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W5Video.html'}, {'title': 'W7Video', 'text': '12bw7_gitlab_remote_add_kaggle_intro.mp4 \n 說明如何在  https://gitlab.com  建立一個與  https://github.com  同名的空倉儲, 然後利用 git remote add 設定一個名稱為 gitlab 的遠端倉儲連線, 然後在 git push 時就可以將近端版本同步一份到 gitlab.com \n 假如希望啟用 gitlab 倉儲上的  gitlab pages , 請參考:  https://mde.tw/lab/blog/use-github-and-gitlab-pages.html \n 必須在倉儲根目錄中放入 .gitlab-ci.yml 設定檔案: \n pages:\n  stage: deploy\n  script:\n  - mkdir .public\n  - cp -r * .public\n  - mv .public public\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n    - public\n  only:\n  - master\nvariables:\n  GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: recursive \n 在原 github 倉儲中加入 .gitlab-ci.yml 並將資料推送至 gitlab 倉儲後, 就可以見到\xa0 https://mdecourse.gitlab.io/cp2020/ \xa0 \n 13bw7_print_function_demo.mp4 \n 說明如何使用 print() 函式', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W7Video.html'}, {'title': 'W1', 'text': '每班按照學號使用固定電腦, 若電腦故障則必須在一週內負責告知助教, 並將電腦第三磁區複製回原始狀態, 若電腦硬體故障則需回報給助教設法請廠商進行維護, 期間則至使用最後一列備用電腦. \n 準備在個人的電腦, 筆電或電腦輔助設計室中的電腦, 製作合用的可攜程式系統. \n W1 學員登入學校配發的 @gm 郵件帳號後, \xa0 填寫基本資料 \n W1 告知將利用 \xa0 Gitter \xa0 進行課程議題討論 (其餘各種問題可以至  discourse  討論) \n https://gitter.im/mdecourse/cp2020 \xa0 \n https://forum.eng.nfu.edu.tw \xa0 \n W1 就電腦軟硬體與網路環境的使用進行介紹 \n 上課時將以 50703199 At mde dot nfu dot edu dot tw  登入 介紹 \n W1 登入 @gm 帳號後, 可以直接利用  https://kaggle.com \xa0中的 Notebook 執行 Python 程式 \n 在 Kaggle 中啟用 GPU 與網路連線需要利用手機門號驗證, 而且一個門號只能驗證一個帳號 \n https://www.kaggle.com/mdecourse/cp2020 \xa0 \n https://www.kaggle.com/mdecourse/ml2020 \xa0 \n Notice: 一甲 9/24 (四) 下午要補 10/2 中秋節連假的課程時段', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W1.html'}, {'title': 'W1_list', 'text': '1. 基本資料填了沒?

generate_pages 按鈕轉為靜態網站資料後, 要利用 git 指令新增提交退送時, 碰到以下問題: \n \n 接著配合畫面中的提示, 利用 git config 指令操作結束後, 接著嘗試以 git push 將改版資料推送到遠端, 結果又出現下列畫面: \n \n 根據提示, 以 git pull 拉下遠端與近端的差異資料後, 又出現下列畫面, 因為提示中拉下的資料與 Leo Editor 有關, 因此在命令列視窗中輸入 leo, 試著開啟 Leo Editor, 結果出現的小視窗無論如何操作都會落入重複迴圈, 於是在 y:\\home\\.leo 目錄中, 以 SciTE 編輯器建立一個 .leoID.txt 檔案, 內容為任何字串, 然後以 stop.bat 關閉可攜系統之後, 再以 start.bat 開啟系統, 終於能夠開啟 Leo Editor, 並利用 git push 將近端資料成功送到 github. \n \n \n 請問, git config --global 指令執行成功後, 這些設定會存在哪裡? \n 另外假如我們不是使用可攜程式套件而是使用電腦輔助設計室中電腦所安裝的 Python 以及 git, 但是卻想在其他用戶所存放的 git config identity 中, 提交屬於自己帳號下的 comment, 該如何操作? \n 上述的流程設定, 必須每一次推送時都輸入 github 所登錄的帳號與密碼, 假如在協同者面前輸入帳號密碼時, 其他人都一直盯著我的鍵盤看, 該如何是好? \n 上述在 git push 之前需要 git pull 的原因是甚麼? \n 上述 Leo Editor 啟動時, 為何會進入重複迴圈? \n CMSiMDE 是用甚麼程式語言建立的? \n CMSiMDE 為什麼有動態網站與靜態網站的設計? \n 假如每一班都配給一台 Ubuntu 20.04 的伺服器, 可以配置與 Windows 10 相同的程式環境嗎? 假如我使用 MacBook 筆電也可以嗎? \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'W2.html'}, {'title': '程式語言', 'text': 'Python \n Python Official
