It promises to usher in an unprecedented convergence of people, business and things that disrupts existing business models - even those born of the Internet and e-business eras. \n Digital Transformation is the novel use of digital technology to solve traditional problems. These digital solutions enable - other than efficiency via automation - new types of innovation and creativity, rather than simply enhance and support traditional methods. Success is anchored in both digital business and digitization. \n Interoperability: The ability of machines, devices, sensors, and people to connect and communicate with each other via the Internet of Things (IoT) or the Internet of People (IoP). \n Information transparency: The ability of information systems to create a virtual copy of the physical world by enriching digital plant models with sensor data. This requires the aggregation of raw sensor data to higher-value context information. \n Technical assistance: First, the ability of assistance systems to support humans by aggregating and visualizing information comprehensibly for making informed decisions and solving urgent problems on short notice. Second, the ability of cyber physical systems to physically support humans by conducting a range of tasks that are unpleasant, too exhausting, or unsafe for their human co-workers. \n Decentralized decisions: The ability of cyber physical systems to make decisions on their own and to perform their tasks as autonomously as possible. Only in the case of exceptions, interferences, or conflicting goals, are tasks delegated to a higher level. \n In addition to being able to adapt to advances in technology, the person needs to be able to communicate and relate to people (from different disciplines, cultures, values) who may not be co-located. Talent in a digitally transforming enterprise ($Talent_{dt}$) can loosely be expressed as follows: \n $Talent_{dt} = Talent + Generative Learning$ \n Generative learning is learning that enhances our capacity to innovate and create. Foundational to it is the active integration of new ideas with the learner’s existing schemata. \n We cannot teach people how to learn what is needed, unlearn what is no longer relevant and re-learn that which is still needed. We can provide an opportunity for people to learn by reflecting on doing (Experiential Learning). \n Machine Learning Applications for Furnamce Control and Process Optimization in Steelmaking.pdf \n 課程助教: \n 40723150 (lead), 40723110, 40723115, 40723138, 40723148 \n 40723145 (lead), 40723102, 40723103, 40723153, 40723245 \n 40723212 (lead), 40723216, 40723223, 40723246 \n 負責事項: \n 電腦輔助設計室電腦第三磁區系統維護 \n 每週四 19:00 - 21:00 在電腦輔助設計室為操作實習與助教協助回答問題時間 \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Topics.html'}, {'title': 'Video', 'text': "本課程所有學員都必須熟悉利用下列工具製作電腦操作過程錄影並協同進行線上直播與錄影: \n ShareX \n 課程進行中的所有操作細節都會利用  ShareX  進行錄影, 並將 mp4 影片檔案放入  cp2020 課程線上教學影片區 , 各學員可以直接利用電腦或手機觀看. \n Google Meet \n https://meet.google.com/ \xa0允許 @gm 用戶進行線上串流對談, 分享電腦操作畫面, 文字留言以及串流影音錄影等功能, 各分組學員必須熟悉如何操作並且在分組後每單數週, 利用  Google Meet  進行線上會議討論與錄影存證. \n Youtube  +\xa0 OBS \n OBS  支援多元的電腦影音來源組合功能, 配合  Youtube  的線上串流直播與錄影功能, 可以讓不參與會議者以文字留言板進行互動或在線上觀看直播.\xa0 各分組學員必須熟悉如何操作並且在分組後每雙數週, 利用  Youtube  +  OBS  進行線上會議討論與錄影存證. \n Wink \n Wink  是一套用來製作電腦操作流程說明用的工具, 之前 2.0 版本的輸出檔案為 Flash swf 檔案格式, 但因各瀏覽器將在  2020 年底停止支援 Flash 播放功能 , 因此目前作者正在測試能夠透過  FFMPEG  輸出 mp4 檔案的版本, 待其正式推出後將可用於課程教學中. \n 以下為參考用的線上影片: \n Deep Learning \n \n 2016 \n By 2020, the workplace will look very different from the one we see today. Companies will function in a vastly more  digitized environment , but 30 percent of them will fail because there aren't enough workers with the skills to drive the  digital transformation  that companies need. \n Analysts are forecasting a global shortage of 38 million to 40 million college-educated workers, a gap that will affect advanced nations as well as emerging countries. And the length of tenure in a job is shortening as well. The average time a worker spends in one job has declined from five to seven years to only two to three years, widening the gap between supply and demand. This session will explore the critical changes that must be made to give workers the skills required in the workforce of tomorrow. \n \n 2017 \n In the eyes of top executives, their job is to imagine the future and work towards making that imagined future a reality. Many of the largest companies in the world are intent on embracing change and building pathways that lead to a robust workforce, innovation and job creation. Corporate leaders must pursue and encourage growth while also promoting values that reach beyond the bottom line. \n How do business leaders build and drive the workforce of the future?  Change can be an amorphous concept; how should corporations define and pursue it?

(可以在近端執行, 也可以部署到 Heroku) \n 能不能轉為網際程式, 讓兩名操作找猜拳對玩? (可以在近端執行, 也可以部署到 Heroku) \n \n 利用 flask scissor rock paper game 搜尋, 可以找到  https://github.com/prof-rossetti/rock-paper-scissors-flask , 套用  https://github.com/s2t2/game-utils-py  模組, 先將程式 clone 下來看看. 並將初步結果放入  https://github.com/mdecourse/scissor-rock-paper  倉儲. \n 接下來要在  http://mde.tw/cp2020/content/Heroku.html  與  https://github.com/mdecourse/nfulist  資料的協助下, 將這個遊戲部署到 Heroku. \n 目前一個 Heroku 帳號只能免費建立 5 個應用程式. \n 目前 Heroku 帳號綁定如下: \n cp2020 -- mdecourse At Gmail  cad2020 -- heroku1 At Mde dot TW (含 cad2021 ~ cad2024)  cp2021 ~ cp2025 -- heroku2 At Mde dot TW  cad2025, mdecp, mdecad, mdewcm, mdecd -- heroku3 At Mde dot TW \n 因此將 scissor-rock-paper 網際程式部署到 Heroku, 並以 heroku4 AT Mde dot TW 綁定, 成為  https://scissor-rock-paper.herokuapp.com/ \n 之後除了可以再延伸為線上兩人猜拳遊戲外, 也可以將網際遊戲中的文字回應改為圖形回應, 並且加入音效或其他動畫增加可玩性, 並且再納入 線上資料庫 , 儲存遊戲紀錄. \n 此一案例的學習要點: \n \n https://github.com/mdecourse/scissor-rock-paper/tree/main/game_utils  模組是如何建立的? \n 如何將一個 Flask 網際程式部署到 Heroku? \n 如何在 Heroku 中將 Flask 程式結果存入 PostgreSQL 資料庫中? \n 這樣的網際程式是否能夠應用到機械設計流程中? \n \n 利用網際程式並部署到 Heroku: \n 版本一:  https://scissor-rock-paper.herokuapp.com/  ( discussion ) \n 版本一只是將  https://github.com/prof-rossetti/rock-paper-scissors-flask  稍微修改為初學者較容易理解的程式架構, 但是其中仍包含 Python 模組的建立與導入引用, 且程式主要判斷邏輯使用  https://github.com/s2t2/game-utils-py  模組的內容. \n 版本二: \n 首先看一下最基本的 Flask 網際程式架構: \n from flask import Flask\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\'/\')\ndef hello_world():\n    return \'Hello, World!\'\n\napp.run(host=\'127.0.0.1\', port=5000) \n 接下來讓電腦可以 randomly 產生 scissor, rock or paper \n from flask import Flask\nimport random\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\'/\')\ndef hello_world():\n    return \'Hello, World!\'\n\n# convert 0, 1, 2 into "scissor, rock or paper"\ndef srp(number):\n    data = ["scissor", "rock", "paper"]\n    return data[number]\n    \n@app.route(\'/computer\')\ndef computer():\n    # must retrun sting\n    # random number 1, 2, 3\n    return srp((random.randint(0,2)))\n    \n\'\'\' now the problem becomes how to get\nuser\'s input through form or url variables\n\'\'\'\n\napp.run(host=\'127.0.0.1\', port=5000) \n 接下來必須了解網際程式如何取得使用者的 inputs: \n https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#variable-rules \n https://www.askpython.com/python-modules/flask/flask-forms \n https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24892035/how-can-i-get-the-named-parameters-from-a-url-using-flask \n https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47363492/flask-url-with-variable-input \n 而且還必須了解網際程式如何透過 session 在使用者點擊過程中儲存變數資料: \n https://pythonbasics.org/flask-sessions/ \n 加入 flask session 與 request 之後, 可以記錄電腦亂數產生的剪刀石頭或布, 並透過\xa0 URL 取得使用者輸入: \n from flask import Flask, session, request\n# in order to save computer generated data, import session\n# in order to get user URL input, import request\nimport random\nimport os\n\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n# to get session working need to set secret_key for app\napp.secret_key = os.urandom(32)\n\n@app.route(\'/\')\ndef hello_world():\n    return \'Hello, World!\'\n \n# convert 0, 1, 2 into "scissor, rock or paper"\ndef srp(number):\n    data = ["scissor", "rock", "paper"]\n    return data[number]\n     \n@app.route(\'/computer\')\ndef computer():\n    # must retrun sting\n    # random number 1, 2, 3\n    #computer generated data: cgd\n    user = request.args.get(\'user\')\n    cgd = srp((random.randint(0,2)))\n    session["computer"] = cgd\n    return "computer: " + str(cgd) + " and user: " + str(user)\n\n@app.route(\'/compare\')\ndef compare():\n    if session.get(\'computer\') != None:\n        # get cgd from session\n        return session.get(\'computer\')\n    else:\n        return "no computer session"\n        \n \napp.run(host=\'127.0.0.1\', port=5000) \n 上列 Flask 網際程式只要再納入 computer 與 user 出拳內容的輸贏比較, 就可以得出結果, 讓使用者與電腦對玩. \n \'\'\'\ndefault user input is \'scissor\'\nhttp://localhost:5000\nhttp://localhost:5000/?user=paper\n\'\'\'\nfrom flask import Flask, session, request\n# in order to save computer generated data, import session\n# in order to get user URL input, import request\nimport random\nimport os\n \n \napp = Flask(__name__)\n# to get session working need to set secret_key for app\napp.secret_key = os.urandom(32)\n\ndef compare(computer, user):\n    if computer == user:\n        return("It\'s a tie!")\n    elif computer == \'rock\':\n        if user == \'scissor\':\n            return("Computer wins!")\n        else:\n            # user = \'paper\'\n            return("Human wins!")\n    elif computer == \'scissor\':\n        if user == \'paper\':\n            return("Computer win!")\n        else:\n            #user = \'rock\'\n            return("Human wins!")\n    elif computer == \'paper\':\n        if user == \'rock\':\n            return("Computer wins!")\n        else:\n            #user =\'scissor\'\n            return("Human win!")\n    else:\n        return("Invalid input!
